# google-ctf-22-write-ups

This repository contains write-ups of the Google CTF 2022 for the following challenges:

- [APPNOTE.TXT (misc)](./appnotedottxt/writeup.md)
- [JS SAFE 4.0 (reversing)](./js-safe-4dot0/writeup.md)

This was the first jeopardy style CTF I participated in and I really enjoyed solving the challenges above.
I hope you will have a lot of fun with them too reading through my write-ups!

## Feedback

Since those are my first write-ups I would appreciate feedback on them, especially if you have suggestions for improvements.
